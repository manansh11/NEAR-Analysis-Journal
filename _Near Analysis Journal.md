## Research Questions
- How do web3 users choose what networks to transact on and engage with?
-  What are the biggest barriers to entry and adoption for users new to NEAR (but existing web3/crypto holders) entering the NEAR ecosystem? 
	-   What is unique to NEAR that affects user adoption compared to other L1s? 
-  What can be done to remove these barriers? 
	- (including through the lens of Discovery, their super app i.e. wallet insights, maybe).

## Important details:
1. We will want to compare between our two profiles (Less vs More Experienced)
2. NEAR would like to know what factors would lead to the profiles to make a SWITCH.
	1. Less experienced -> from using nothing or a major L1 to using NEAR
	2. More experienced -> from using their regular L1 to using or adding NEAR to their ecosystem

		This is a research topic that is not only valuable to stakeholders, but is also meaningful for participants.
		We can easily answer the research questions presented.
	OPINIONS
		People don't user NEAR because they don't have a strong reason to use.
			No KILLER dApps that aren't found anywhere else
		Usage is driven by being active in a community.
		This research will help support *wallet* type products.
		Whether someone will install a wallet or not is a strong signal of their willingness to adopt
	BELIEFS
		Network usage is defined by habits which start with community participation.
Your thoughts about how your specific study/approach can impact your data or findings
	THOUGHTS ON STUDY APPROACH
		We're going to be speaking with people who are classified as crypto-new & crypto-experienced WHO HAVE NOT USED NEAR. We'll start by grounding our conversation by talking about past experiences with onboarding to a new network. This will get us frictions, pain points, and overall a better understand the goals they have when onboardings
		Eventually, we'll get them to actually onboard into the ecosystem & see how far they get. I am feeling confident that our study design will allow us to learn alot from our participants.
Your expectations or anxieties about the data you'll collect, the things you'll learn, or the participants you'll interact with
	EXPECTATIONS OR ANXIETIES
		we ask the wrong questions
		we don't learn anything useful
		the learnings aren't valuable to the ecosystem
		our particiapants have a bad experience
		our participants share very obvious & surface-level insights
		our questions are too general to be helpful
		we won't make very actionable recommendations



## NEAR's GOALS
- NEAR is the blockchain operating system: brand, marketing
    -   100% of content and processes running on NEAR Discovery
    -   30% of NEAR community is using Discovery
    -   3M Twitter followers and 2x increase in SOV (share of voice)

## Expected Learnings
-   How do web3 users choose what networks to transact on and engage with?
	    - Both groups choose networks based on the types of communities they're involved in.
	    - Less experienced users choose networks that most other people use
	    - Less experienced users choose networks that their friends/fellow community members use
	    - More experienced choose networks based on
		    - ease of use
		    - cost
		    - values
			    - decentralization
			    - security & privacy
		- Both groups (skewed towards More Experienced) create a personal "ecosystem" that comprises of multiple networks that they regularly use.
-   What are the biggest barriers to entry and adoption for users new to NEAR (but existing web3/crypto holders) entering the NEAR ecosystem?
	- Finding a wallet that they can trust with funds
		- Having to keep track of YET another private key
		- Not understanding how to easily setup a wallet
	- Not knowing where to find relevant onboarding information
	- Not being a part of a community that is built on NEAR
		- None of their colleagues or friends are using NEAR
	- Nothing interesting to use on NEAR
	- Discovery & Onboarding happening at the Application Layer (different dApps) and they:
		- Don't onboard properly
    
-   What is unique to NEAR that affects user adoption compared to other L1s? 
	- focus on education
	- easy onboarding
	- innovations around wallet creation
	- incredibly unique dapps
	- community-first approach
    
-   What can be done to remove these barriers? (including through the lens of Discovery, their super app i.e. wallet insights, maybe).

## Kolb Cycles
### Step 1: Experience

start with some experience → outline it

---
WRITE HERE:
I felt nervous & a bit disappointed in the pilot interview guide.

---


### Step 2: Reflection

fill in the details around this experience

-   Questions to consider
    -   how did you feel
    -   when did you feel this way
    -   if you struggled, at what points? Were there any triggers?
    -   How did you react?
    -   how did others react?
    -   Were there any other factors that might have affected your experience before the experience? For example, perhaps you were tired, or it was during a stressful period.
    -   What did you do at each step? Try to draw out a step-by-step recount or chronology of events
    -   How did you respond to difficulty or struggle?
    -   how did you feel before, during, and after the event?

----

WRITE HERE:
I felt, during the interview, a bit self-conscious, and out of flow. My mind was definitely trying to process something while the interview was running which resulted in me feeling a bit nervous & anxious about the interview itself & the data collection process. 

I felt this way a few times. The first time was when I was asking my follow-up questions in the first half of the call. The second time happened when I was trying to figure out how to manage the user testing portion of the call.

The triggers were when I felt that I wasn't getting the answer to the question that I was asking or that I felt like I was losing track of what the participant was saying & having to bring myself back to it, missing some of what they were saying. Another trigger was internal, maybe a belief around my ability as a researcher.

I reacted to this by working through this. I kept the interview going. I eventually did take control of the conversation & moved it back on track.

My participant seemed fine. They want to help. They want to help me answer my questions. But sometimes the way we ask questions can lead to miscommunication & misunderstandings.

This was my first interview back from MESO project. So I do think there were some cob-webs in this call. 

At the beginning of the call, the intro felt a bit stiff & not natural, the transition to the topic was good. Our top-level question where we ask about discovery of another chain seemed like a difficult question to start off on, something we can definitely reword. Specifically, it seemed like  going back SO far in time served to be difficult. I wonder if it makes more sense to scope that question to the last month or the NEWEST CHAIN they've transacted on only. Afterwards, we moved onto their onboarding experience. This question was good. The follow-ups could be a bit more refined, but it was alright. Afterwards we moved onto perspectives on NEAR. The follow-up questions I asked were a bit jarring but I still think they were good.

We then moved onto the activity. I think a bit more handholding around the instructions will be helpful. The participant should know that they'll be required to share their screen & so they can clear out any of their tabs. We should also ask them to have a digital notepad ready just in case they need it (wallet onboarding).

The discovery section is a lot of observation & asking how & why they go about learning more about NEAR. The question mark I have in my mind is that I am not sure how natural this onboarding process actually is. Are they seeing the tweet & just going to the website? Are they guided by a protocol or project they want to use? I am just not sure. I noticed that we will have to be very CLEAR & tell the participant when they can stop.

The onboarding section was a bit harder to manage. With the private key. It is important that we preface that this is a dummy wallet. I also wasn't really sure when to end. When the wallet is setup? When the wallet is setup AND they can find something they want to transact with?

The ending was fine.

I responded to this struggle by just continuing through it. I didn't really stop. I didn't do much else actually.

Before I felt a bit nervous. During I felt a bit anxious. And after I felt that there was still a lot of work to still do.


---

### Step 3: Abstraction

focus on generalized, transferable, and abstracted reasons as to why we experienced all those things we wrote about in our reflection.

-   Questions to consider
    -   how do I normally act in these kinds of experiences?
    -   What about my overall mindset or strategy that is making me prone to certain classes of mistakes and errors?
    -   Do I make similar errors in other areas?
    -   What habits do I seem to have in certain types of experiences that make me behave, react or act in this way?


----

WRITE HERE:

Managing yourself during an interview is important. Being mindful of your triggers & understanding that your reactivity will influence that data you collect.

Being okay with asking the question that you have, and no more.

Making sure the participant has all the tools they need to be successful.

Testing early & often so that you actually have data to work with.

---



### Step 4: Experimentation

think about simple experiments we can conduct that we will think can solve the issue. expect failure and really focus on seeing “why” you failed.

----

WRITE HERE:

create a pre-interview checklist that makes sure you've got all the pieces in place, including dealing with anxiety or expectations.

## Creating Interview Guide
Trying to think through relevant open-ended questions that will help us learn more about the topic at hand.

Some points is that they should be:
- focused & unambiguous
- provide boundaries & necessary context
- no answer is implied in the question
- simple language
- as short as needed

Struggling with actually fashioning the questions to be asked. 

*March 1, 2023*
	- had a conversation with georgia about the interview guide. she is aligned on the topics. 
	- we spoke about adding how they came to *discover* the new L1. so we will focus on understanding their discovery & onboarding experiences from a previous L1.
	- we also touched on the importance of understanding their current *reservations* with the NEAR protocol -- maybe they had a past experience or some perception of the chain that we can learn more about.
	- aligned on the general direction of the user test
	- make use of TIMEBOXING to help manage time -- "We only have 15 minutes to do X"
	- DISCOVERY STARTS
		- we can serve the user a tweet from the NEAR protocol that will prompt USERS to act
	- DISCOVERY ENDS
		- a bit of discussion on where this should end. we landed on 3 ways to categorize this.
		1. they decide nothing is special about NEAR
		2. they decide that NEAR is something they would swap into
		3. they find an application or use case that really WOWs them
	- ONBOARDING STARTS
		- We nudge them to try and get a wallet based on context that would be RELEVANT to them (what we learn from a screener or from the interview)
	- ONBOARDING ENDS
		- 2 ways to think about this
		1. Ends when they find somthing they would participate in (Longer)
		2. Finish setting up a wallet. (Shorter)
*March 2, 2023*
	- had a call with georgia this morning about the screener service we will be using, we have access to 350 people, so no recruitment worries there. I have access to the software so I can set it all up.
	- need to finalize the questions and also think about our approach to the user testing section, that is the only real unknown, want to also callibrate the flow of questions.
	- also need to figure how to approach the filtering process but currently not a priority.
	- the priority right now is to transport the moderation guide over to the google sheet.
	- moved all the questions over to the moderation guide, cleaned up a few of them, tomorrow we should double check if they are actually going to help us answer our research questions
*March 5 2023*
	Today we finalized the discussion guide -- will pilot with estela to see what our results are.
	Currently in the process of figuring out & setting up the screener + written copy for the emails.

A few other tasks we can tackle
- [x] Evaluating Research Goals with Interview Questions Again
- [x] Research NEAR ecosystem a bit more


## Fixing & Creating Our Screener
We have access to the Web3UX sampling frame.

There are about ~350 people in that frame -- we'll send our screener out and see what they say. It's HIGHLY unlikely we don't find 15 people to speak with.

I edited the email copy for the emails that will be sent to participants. I also took some time to adjust the screener copy as well. 

I linked up the calendly with the relevant ZOOM account & more. The only ? is coordinating with Georgia on running the first two calls.

- [x] Double-check screener & email flow with Georgia
- [x] Figure out if there are any dependencies (georgia's email) that will stop me while she is away
- [x] Coordinate first 2 calls with Georgia 

## Pilot with Estela
think about if the questions are getting at the TOPIC
	specifically, be critical about the follow-ups

spending less time on the first half, really honing in on the follow-ups.
followups on the perspectives on NEAR, were those useful?

Onboarding Activity:
- how to prompt users to keep going
- how to determine when they're done
- maybe better instructions?
- how to prompt them when onboarding ends?
review question execution (actually saying it)

List of things to look at.
- [x] rewatch pilot // reread book & course
- [x] make changes to the guide to hone it in
- [x] do a kolbs
- [x] start recruiting

### Notes
- more flow in the introduction - a bit more natural -- let them know about silence & the specific questions. **DONE**
- manage the "can you tell me a bit about yourself?" -- maybe we can make this a bit more crypto-centric? (Limit to 2-3 minutes if you can) **DONE**
- topic introduction transition -- use this time to prime their brains to look back in time.
	- tell me about how you became aware of the [LAYER-1] network, and what initially drew you to it?
		- say this question directly. 
		- this seems to work.
		- how do you follow-up on interesting threads?
			- Refer to Apple & Oranges // Portigal Book on this
	- when acknowledging & summarizing what someone has just said, try not to waffle too much. acknowledge & just ask the follow-up. say back what they said to you. then ask your question.
		- Also, don't add variables to the question. Ask the question as it is.
	- When following up. Don't be afraid to ask the main question. And be silent. If they need clarification. Wait for them to ask you.
- Activity beginning
	- make sure to clarify when this ends.
	- don't ask why too directly.
		- maybe take a more curious tone
			- "I noticed you've opened two tabs here. Why did you do that?"
	- speaking back or summarizing is effective? not sure
	- get them away from critiquing the resources, but staying true to their process.
	- at the end of discovery, ask any follow-ups.
- Actual Wallet Onboarding
	- better instructions & the beginning
	- follow along with what they're saying
	- at the end of onboarding, ask any follow-ups.

## First Call with Participant
- Make sure Zoom Permissions are fixed

## Things to deal with March 13, 2022
Not many less experienced users on our panel -- may need to get creative -- find another channel -- work with georgia to find people

(Adding to intro)
		Where are you in the world
		What do you do for work

(Adding to intro)
Started using most recently...

(When the first topic was reached)
She introduced the topic. And, in her own way, created a question that highlights what we're trying to learn about
	"*So I'm really interested in why you might choose one network over another. And so, so let, let's talk a little bit about that. Are there any particular, you know, for, for example, you, you've played with some, but not all. So I'm wondering why those, why those ones and not others that, that are out there?*""

As I was listening to Georgia, I was noticing how she was able to direct and manage the context. She knew what the goals of the study were & used that to power follow-ups.


Screensharing Setting on Zoom

Figuring out our strategy for coding. There is open coding, which essentially means that we'll code as we go. And there are a few types of codes -- we've got in-vivo (which basically uses the participants words as the code label), descriptive (to summarize a concept) & we've also got process which just describes the process that is occuring at a higher level


## Made Changes To Starting Point
Made a change to where people are actually starting on the twitter page.
Seems to work well.
## Beginning the Tagging Process
We've gotten around 4 interview completed thus far. And we're learning a whole lot. Now we can start tagging things.

A question that I have is surrounding the quantity of tags & if they need to be duplicated or not. My intuitition is telling me that it's ok to just create new tags. Then bring them together later as we begin to clean & re-do the categories.

So my strategy is to use a combination of in-vivo & descriptive codes, leaning on descriptive codes.

How will we actually analyze???? I think we group codes into categories & then find patterns across categories.


Added question: Is there something that you especially want to know, see or be able to do to see whether near is something that you would use?


## Early Learnings

Users learn about new networks through people that they know or trust
	people they follow online
	people they actually know (friend, colleague)
	they want to use a project (DeFi, NFT) that is found only on that network

The NEAR wallet doesn't let people connect to dApps without having tokens in the wallet which is frustrating

The path to getting a NEAR wallet doesn't make that much sense

The wallet - dApp ecosystem experience is not ideal (unsure which wallet works with which dapps)

The difference between NEAR & Aurora is unclear

The role of media (social & traditional) in shaping if people use NEAR or not

"Blockchain OS" is a confusing concept.

## On-going Dialogue

>Running an interview with another user.

Most of the interviews have been tagged, I need to finish 2 of them, but don't forget the goals of the study,

On the last stretch of interviews... Finding lots of interesting data points to report on.

Last interview is completed. Now we've got to tag the remaining calls & start our analysis this week, if possible.


*No mention of Aurora outside of Dev Page*
*What does Blockchain OS mean?*


## Finished Tagging // Now Strategizing Analysis

> [!note]  This is a workspace for me to organize & recategorize tags

So this is the strategy I will use to start performing analysis. We have many tags. Some of them are quite similar sounding. We want to begin creating categories for these tags. Once we start having the categories created, we can then work towards creating some initial themes...

- [x] re-read our codes & start to see if we can re-label ??

So I am starting analysis by creating major groups of labels -- lots of these groups:
- Ethereum
- NEAR
- Polygon
- Other Networks

I will continue grouping this way for a bit -- so that we have initial categories -- way too high level to be useful.

The next step after doing that is to create new categories from the categories we initially made. And go through that cycle...

Ok we've categorized all of the tags at a high level -- the next step is to begin thinking of organizing tags even further-- this first level of categorization is simply to organize things into major topic areas... we will then create new & unique tags as we go...

Here is the ultimate list:
- NEAR (519 tags)
- Polygon (53 tags)
- Ethereum (25 tags)
- Other Networks (46 tags)
- Wallets (37 tags)
- Personal (187 tags)

Let's start with:
1. NEAR
2. Personal
3. Polygon
4. Other Network
5. Wallet
6. Ethereum

### NEAR Categorization Process
So the NEAR tags should be categorized with the following understanding... This data is collected as the participants are going through the activity -- so, aside from what they say, we can also see where they are -- what they are doing -- what they are trying to do -- and so forth.

Some initial categories:

Aurora

NEAR Wallet

"What is this?"

Near.org Website

Ecosystem (AwesomeNEAR, AlphaNEAR, DaPPs)

Accessibility Issues

Unclear Messaging

How they learn about NEAR?

Not seeing Value


### April 4th 2023 (1st Pass on Categorization Process)
How did I pick the categories that I did?
	These categories are just initial, logical, guesses. They are subject to change, and will likely change.
	The strategy was as follows: we have >800 tags. So I bucketed them across categories that were very large. I then will go into each bucket, and bucket them again, and again, and again. At the end, we should end up with categories or buckets that are distinctively different, with similar tags within them.

*After categorizing most of the tags in NEAR*
We'll go to the *personal* tag!

NEAR (Parent Category)
	Sub-categories
		Wallet
		Aurora
		"What is it"
		NEAR.org Website
		Ecosystem (AwesomeNEAR, AlphaNEAR)
		How they learn about NEAR
		Not seeing value
		Financial & Profits

Personal (Parent Category)
	Sub-categories
		"How they learn"
		Negative Emotions/Reactions
		Behaviour/Use-cases
		Looking for Trust
		Internal Positions

Polygon (Parent Category)
	Sub-categories
		Use-cases & behaviours
		How they learned about Polygon
		Challenges
		Positive Reactions

Let's do "Other Networks now" -- The goal with this is that we'll eventually get the categories trimmed down to a more manageable *chunk* of tags -- which we can then re-build, transpose, compare, and contrast with other chunks.

Other Network (Parent Category)
	Sub-categories
		How they learned about other network
		Perception & Behaviour
		Struggle & Challenges
		Reasons for Use

This one was less meaningful to categorize -- but that is likely due to a small amount of fatigue -- let's keep going.

Wallet (Parent)
	Sub
		Positive Experience 
		Metamask
		Negative Experience
		Behaviour & Preferences

Ethereum (Parent)
	Sub
		Perspectives
		Behaviour

We've now gone through the first pass when it comes to categorizing. We now have a total of:  ~28 categories (we initially started with 6-7)

---
### NEAR Categorization Focus
Here are the categories we have for NEAR. Our task now, is to go into each category, and build more...

Here is the structure right now:
	NEAR (Parent)
		Wallet
		Aurora
		"What is it?"
		NEAR.org Website
		Ecosystem (AwesomeNEAR, AlphaNEAR, dApps)
		How they learn about NEAR
		Not seeing Value
		Financial & Profits

We'll start at the top, and begin our process again of building sub-sub categories. Again, we're doing this so that we can eventually get down to *atomic* chunks of tags that are all similar. These chunks should be distinct from all other chunks.

Starting with NEAR Wallet
	What are the sub-chunks?
			Easy Wallet Setup
			Connection Frustration
			Browser Wallet
			Confusing Instructions
			Metamask Expectations
			Wallet Features
			Discovery Woes

Realizing that there are some *orphaned* tags that don't really have a sub-category that we can allocate to them. We can revisit as we go along.

#### Double Checking Categorization Process
Categories should be distince & on the same level (level of importance & should be logical)
	Codes within categories should *feel* very related

Think of each category as *wearing* a uniform, if a code isn't wearing that uniform, it should be in that category.

The categorization should *fit* the data.

KEEP GOING! KEEP GETTING THOSE CATEGORIES MADE!

Moving onto Aurora
	What are the sub-chunks?
		What's the link?
		Positive Reaction
		What is Aurora?

Let's keep going...

Moving onto "What is it" **REVISIT THIS**
	What are the sub-chunks

NEAR // Near.org Website (DONE)
	Confusing Copy
	Website Problems
	Positive Website
	"Not for me"
	Things Missing

NEAR // ECOSYSTEM (REVISIT THIS)
	AwesomeNEAR (Break Apart)
	AlphaNEAR (Break Apart)
	Recognizable dApps
	Bad Explorer

looking for usage before switching...


> [!tip] SOME THOUGHTS
> the Near.org website has the available dApps much later in the experience. Both developers & users may find value in seeing this information much earlier.
> 
> "Polygon has a big ecosystem" // "They are actively building" // "Looking for usage"
> And end-users saying "What can I use?"

> New networks make sense only when there is a killer reason to use...
> 

> [!attention]  NEXT STEPS
> We've now gone through all of the categories thus far... (on a first pass), We still need to refine & break down some other categories to better reflect the data within. This means we need to do a second pass on *select* categories that need it the most.

## Coding and Theming
merge & clean codes if you need to
themes depend on the researcher
	is your categories relevant to your RQ?
themes depend on your research questions
1. What is this data telling me about my research questions???
	1. What have I learned?
		1. just make sure there is evidence...
2. How do I tell others what i learned???
	1. Imagine having to explain findings at a conference
	2. What's the story of this data?
3. Do free-writing'



![[Pasted image 20230408130714.png]]


## To do:
- Finish checking the rest of the transcripts
- Sort & categorize any other codes
- Begin building some themes
- Create a draft report

-> NEAR.org is similar to Polygon website
-> Aurora website is much better


## Building Top-line Report
We're currently in the process of developing themes so that we can answer the research questions.

I've analyzed everything -- and have created categories -- and have started pulling out themes that fit the research question that I am trying to answer.

What I need to do now is go back through each, theme & each learning, and find supporting quotes, evidence & extra material.
- quotes
- screenshots with annotations
- comparison between existing & new users

## Analysis: User Journey Map???
keep in mind the two user groups?? (is the distinction useful? -- probably)
	2 seperate user journeys?
	comparison & contrast?

## Top-Line Report
We've gathered all the themes & findings that we would like to share. It's now time to take those and put it on a slide-deck...

A list of questions I have:
- Who will be consuming this data?
	- NEAR Community
	- NEAR Foundation
	- People building on NEAR
- What do they care about?
	- Easy access
	- Relevant learnings
- How can I tailor the findings so that it becomes relevant to the consumers of this data?
	- not sure.. try.
- What should I put on the slide-deck?
	- Findings
	- Quotes                                  
	- Images
	- Brand assets
- How many slides should we have?
	- <30 (this is likely not possible)
	- >30 if we need a longer version to send with more detail
- What story do we want to tell?
	- The old story of NEAR -- 
	- NEAR is currently in a period of change & growth. Touching on the new focus (BOS) & bringing forward the themes of user friendliness & UX they wish to bring forth.
		- Things are a bit uncertain, however the ecosystem & community is hyped.
	- This Research will help them get to where they want to go. A bridge
	- But first, let's zoom out & understand the discovery process & onboarding process of web3 users who aren't on NEAR
		- RQ: How do web3 decide which networks to use?
		- Recommendations to builders & ecosystem peeps
	- Going back to NEAR & it's period of growth & change.
	- NEAR Discovery & Onboarding
		- RQ: Barriers to entry & adoption
			- Discovery (growing pains)
			- Onboarding (growing pains)
	- What is NEARs next adventure?
		- Takeaways
		- Recommendations
		- Top 3 things for builders to learn

Full sentences for the findings???

## KOLBS  -- Report Writing  (April 17th, 2023)
Experience: I am finding it really difficult to get the report together

Reflection:

I felt a small level of panic & resistance to creating the report & wondering if it is truly *good* enough. I felt panicked and anxious & resorted to my old unhealthy coping mechanisms that were avoidant and not directly facing the issue. It made me also feel a lot of stress & anxiety & fear. 

I felt this way during the weekend & last week. I just couldn't get myself to work on the report. I am feeling it most acutely right now. There is a heaviness in my chest. Anxiety in my belly. A fatigue.

I struggled really to get started. I just didn't want to move. The procrastination leading to a build-up of work that still needs to get done. The triggers were psychological & psych-emotional. Another trigger was the feeling of not being good enough, and caring really hard about how people perceive me. That is bring about tons of suffering.

I reacted to this stress by making use of coping mechanisms that I know are unhealthy for me. Instead of setting short goals, like in the walk, I decided to try to do other things completely. The cognitive drains seemed just way too high. 

Others haven't reacted yet & that is what is worrying me. I am realizing that I am not correcting the belief that this opportunity is also for learning -- and I can worry less about being good & worry more about being true to myself & setting standards for myself. Taking 100% responsibility for what is happening, in whatever situation I am in, and taking a glass-half full approach to this situation. What opportunities still exist. What can I do now?

After completing analysis (which I am still anxious of), I found it difficult transitioning over to the theming process -- I moved the data over to fig jam, where the report is continuing to be constructed. There is also a google slide. I think a major headache is around a level of perfectionism & mental blocks and not just getting my hands dirty while trying out the report structure & format. Thinking of that seems like the right thing to be doing, but some part of me doesn't find that natural. I then, instead of working, did something else, procrastinated it away.

Before, during analysis I felt okay, I think the social aspect of having to share your work with the world is unnerving me, there seems to be a tension building up in my mind around this. My work != My sense of self-worth. This is a learning experience. Stay away from context switching.


Abstract:

I tend to, when faced with a lot of tension & stress, react by engaging in maladaptive behaviors to help cope. I haven't taken the time to learn from those experiences yet. But I am now seeing the value in doing so.

I think procrastinating and caring about my standing/perception with other people made me engage in a fake productivity. Worrying about how others perceive me & how that will make me feel. It makes me feel unsafe. 

I think a habit that has been developed is that when a perceived stressful tasks presents itself, I don't give myself unadulterated time away to really focus on it. By engaging in context switching, the brain gets overloaded, and emotions of guilt, shame, social anxiety, fear, and much more present themselves.

When the stress is low, there isn't a need to cope. When it is really high -- the cope looks a bit different. 

Also, instead of asking for help quicker, I don't ask for help, and things devolve mentally. 


Experiment:
- Work on a seperate machine away from discord
- Set really small goals & avoid procrastination
- Have a list of reminders to remind you of important facts
